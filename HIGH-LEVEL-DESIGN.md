# High-Level Design

## System Architecture Overview

### Core Components and Interactions
- **DiscountCodes.GrpcService**: Hosts the gRPC API for discount code operations (generation, validation, usage tracking).
- **DiscountCodes.Grpc.Client**: Consumes the gRPC API, acting as a client for external systems or frontends.
- **DiscountCodes.Persistence**: Implements data access and storage using Entity Framework Core and SQLite (can be swapped with SQL Server or PostgreSQL in production).
- **DiscountCodes.Cryptography**: Provides cryptographic utilities for secure code generation.
- **DiscountCodes.Abstractions/Core**: Defines interfaces, models, and shared logic for extensibility and separation of concerns.

Component interaction is primarily via gRPC calls and dependency injection.  
Persistence is abstracted behind repositories, and cryptography is encapsulated for security.

### Key Architectural Decisions and Rationales
- **gRPC for Service Communication**: Chosen for efficient, strongly-typed, cross-platform communication.
- **Entity Framework Core with SQLite**: Enables rapid development and local testing. For production, SQL Server or PostgreSQL is recommended.
- **Modular Project Structure**: Promotes separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability.
- **Abstractions and Interfaces**: Facilitate extensibility and future integration with other services or data stores.
- **EF Core vs Dapper/ADO.NET**: EF Core chosen for productivity, migrations, and cross-database support. Dapper was considered but deprioritized due to additional boilerplate and weaker migration tooling.

### System Boundaries and Interfaces
- **External Interface**: gRPC API defined in `discount.proto`, consumed by clients or future web UI/partner systems.
- **Internal Interfaces**: Repository and service abstractions for business logic and data access.

### Technical Constraints and Trade-offs
- SQLite is lightweight and suitable for dev/test, but not ideal for high concurrency â†’ swap with SQL Server or PostgreSQL for production.

### Design Patterns and Standards
- Dependency Injection (DI)
- Repository Pattern
- Service Layer Pattern
- Protocol Buffers for API definition

## Implementation Guidelines

### Technology Stack Recommendations
- .NET 8.0 (standard SDK/runtime)
- Entity Framework Core 8
- gRPC
- SQLite (development)

### Performance, Scalability, and Security Considerations
- Use SQL Server or PostgreSQL for production workloads.
- Used async operations throughout for scalability.
- Validated and sanitized all inputs.
- Enabled structured logging (e.g., Serilog) and distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)[this can be configured in future].
- Consider containerization (Docker/Kubernetes) for deployment.

## Discount Code Uniqueness & Concurrency Handling

### Ensuring Uniqueness of Discount Codes
- **Algorithmic Generation**: Codes generated via secure random algorithm, minimizing collisions.
- **Database Constraints**: Unique index/constraint on the `code` column.
- **Validation Checks**: Codes checked against existing entries before persisting.
- **Retries on Collision**: New codes generated if duplicates are detected.

### Handling Race Conditions & Concurrent Writes
- **Transactional Operations**: Code generation and persistence wrapped in DB transactions for atomicity.
- **Optimistic Concurrency**: EF Core concurrency tokens or DB row versioning used to detect conflicts.
- **Retries on Failure**: Failed writes retried with new codes.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: How do I add a new discount code type?**  
A: Implement the relevant interface in `DiscountCodes.Abstractions` and register via DI.

**Q: How do I scale the service?**  
A: Deploy behind a load balancer, use a scalable database, ensure stateless service design.

### Maintenance and Scaling Considerations
- Modular design allows independent updates.
- Database migrations managed via EF Core.
- Logging, monitoring, and tracing strongly recommended for production.

### Integration Points
- gRPC API for external systems.
- Repository interfaces for custom data stores.
- Potential extension with REST or GraphQL for broader accessibility.
